- Cost: $10-15/year typically

### Step 2: Configure DNS
Add these DNS records at your domain registrar:

**For apex domain (yourname.com):**
```
Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.108.153
```
```
Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.109.153
```
```
Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.110.153
```
```
Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

**For www subdomain:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: yourusername.github.io
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
2. Under "Custom domain", enter your domain
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait for DNS check (can take up to 48 hours)
5. Once verified, check "Enforce HTTPS"

## üìä Analytics (Optional)

Want to see how many people visit your site?

### Google Analytics (Free)

1. **Create Account**
   - Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
   - Create account and property
   - Get your Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)

2. **Add to Website**
   Add this code before `</head>` in all HTML files:
   ```html
   <!-- Google Analytics -->
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
   <script>
     window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
     function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
     gtag('js', new Date());
     gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
   </script>
   ```

3. **Commit and Push**
   - Save files
   - Commit and push changes
   - Analytics will start tracking in 24 hours

## üîí HTTPS/SSL

GitHub Pages automatically provides free HTTPS for your site!

- If using `yourusername.github.io`: HTTPS is automatic
- If using custom domain: Enable in Settings > Pages after DNS verification

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading

**Check Deployment Status:**
1. Go to repository > Actions tab
2. Look for latest deployment workflow
3. If failed, click to see error details

**Common Fixes:**
- Make sure repository name is exactly `yourusername.github.io`
- Check that repository is public
- Verify main branch is selected in Pages settings
- Wait 5 minutes and try again

### 404 Error

- Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
- File names are case-sensitive (Index.html ‚â† index.html)
- Check that all file paths are correct

### Images Not Loading

- Use relative paths: `images/photo.jpg` not `/images/photo.jpg`
- Check file extensions match (jpg vs JPG)
- Make sure images are committed and pushed

### Changes Not Showing

- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait 2-3 minutes after pushing
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Map Not Working

- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify internet connection (map needs CDN)
- Make sure coordinates are numbers in `travel.js`

## üì± Testing Before Deployment

Before deploying, test your site locally:

1. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser
2. **Test all pages:**
   - Click every navigation link
   - Test carousel arrows and dots
   - Click map markers
   - Try contact form
   - Check on mobile (resize browser)

3. **Check Console:**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for errors in Console tab
   - Fix any JavaScript errors

4. **Validate HTML:**
   - Go to [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org)
   - Upload each HTML file
   - Fix any errors
