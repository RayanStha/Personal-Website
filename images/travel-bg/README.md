# Travel Section Background Photos

These photos will be the **full-screen rotating backgrounds** for your Travel section.

## üìÅ Where These Photos Go

Add your travel scenic/landscape photos here:
- `travel1.jpg`
- `travel2.jpg`
- `travel3.jpg`
- `travel4.jpg`
- `travel5.jpg`

## üé® What Makes These Different?

### `images/home/` Photos (Homepage):
- Photos **with YOU in them**
- Personal travel photos
- You are the subject

### `images/travel-bg/` Photos (Travel Section Background):
- **Scenic/landscape shots** of destinations
- Beautiful views, landmarks, cityscapes
- **WITHOUT you** as the main focus
- These create the atmosphere for your travel section

### `images/travel/` Photos (Map Pin Clicks):
- Specific to each destination on the map
- Show when users click a map pin
- Can include you or be scenic

## üì∏ Photo Examples

### Good for `travel-bg`:
- Sunset over Paris
- Mountain landscape in Switzerland
- Beach view in Mexico
- City skyline at night
- Iconic landmarks
- Scenic vistas
- Nature shots from your travels

### NOT for `travel-bg` (use `images/home` instead):
- Selfies with landmarks
- Group photos
- Photos where you're the main subject
